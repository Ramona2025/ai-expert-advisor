# AI-Powered Expert Advisor for Industrial Robots

## Product Definition

### Describe the Problem

**Business Problem**:
The company faces significant challenges in providing timely and efficient support for their industrial robots across various regions. Technicians must navigate complex configurations and troubleshooting tasks, which is time-consuming and error-prone. The current support tools are outdated, leading to long resolution times, frequent escalations, and downtime, which directly impacts the company’s ability to maintain production efficiency and quality.

**Current Approach**:
Technicians rely on manual searches through a knowledge base or escalate issues to human experts. This process is slow, cumbersome, and often leads to delayed response times, especially when the information is not readily accessible.

**Biggest Problems with the Current Approach**:
- Slow response times due to the need for technicians to manually search for information.
- High escalation rate, where simple problems require human intervention.
- Limited access to multi-language support, resulting in challenges for technicians in different regions.
- Complex configurations and maintenance tasks are difficult to resolve without deep expertise.

### Describe the Solution

**Solution**:
The AI-powered Expert Advisor is a conversational assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-time, accurate, and context-aware troubleshooting, configuration, and maintenance guidance for industrial robots. This solution will:
- Streamline the troubleshooting process, enabling technicians to resolve issues faster.
- Provide multilingual support to cater to global operations (English, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Urdu).
- Minimize the need for human escalation by offering real-time advice on a wide range of issues.

**What Makes This Product Appealing**:
- **Instant support**: Technicians receive immediate answers, drastically reducing downtime.
- **Context-aware interactions**: The system tailors its responses based on the specific robot and issue, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
- **Scalable**: It supports thousands of robots, configurations, and languages, making it suitable for large global operations.

**How This Is Better Than the Current Approach**:
The AI-powered system allows technicians to bypass the slow, manual search process and receive contextually relevant answers instantly. Unlike static databases, the LLM can provide dynamic, evolving responses based on real-time data.

### Identify Risks and Mitigations

**Risk: Faulty Instructions Leading to Unsafe Operations**
- **Mitigation**: Implement a human verification system for critical tasks and configure safety validation checks to prevent harmful actions.
  - Example: Before applying configurations that might affect the robot's movement, the system asks for explicit confirmation.

**Risk: Incorrect Data (Hallucinations of Part Numbers or Configurations)**
- **Mitigation**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve data from verified sources, ensuring the AI only produces grounded, reliable responses.
  - Example: The system can pull the latest robot manuals or parts catalogs before generating answers.

**Risk: Lack of User Trust in AI-Powered System**
- **Mitigation**: Regular model fine-tuning and continuous human oversight to ensure high-quality outputs. Additionally, offer feedback mechanisms to collect user input for improvement.
  - Example: After each troubleshooting session, users can rate the helpfulness of the advice.

**Risk: Data Privacy Issues**
- **Mitigation**: Use end-to-end encryption for all interactions and adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Ensure that sensitive data is anonymized and securely stored.
  - Example: Technicians’ personal data should never be stored or shared, and all interactions with the AI are encrypted.

### System Details

**System Attributes**
- **Primary Goal**: To provide real-time, context-aware technical support for technicians troubleshooting and configuring industrial robots, using an AI-driven expert advisor powered by LLM technology.
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Provide multi-language support for technicians in different global regions.
  - Ensure scalability so the solution can support thousands of configurations and robots across diverse environments.

**System Architecture**  
Here’s a breakdown of the system components:
- **Technician’s Device (Mobile/Desktop)**: The interface through which technicians interact with the AI.
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests from the technician’s device to the backend systems.
- **LLM (Core)**: The heart of the solution, responsible for processing queries and generating responses.
- **Retrieval System**: Handles queries to the knowledge base, ensuring accurate data is retrieved for relevant responses.
- **Knowledge Base**: Contains structured technical documentation, including manuals, troubleshooting guides, and parts lists.
- **Human Oversight Module**: A safety feature that flags high-risk queries for human review.

---

### **LLM Configuration**
- **Temperature**: Set to 0.7 to balance creativity and accuracy.
- **Token Limit**: High limit (e.g., 4,000 tokens) to handle lengthy technical documents and troubleshooting steps.
- **Fine-tuning**: The LLM should be fine-tuned on company-specific knowledge (robot manuals, troubleshooting guides, parts catalogs) to improve response accuracy.
- **Multilingual Support**: The model must be trained to understand and respond in English, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Urdu.

---

### Success Metrics
To define the success of the AI-powered Expert Advisor, the following metrics will be tracked:
- **Resolution Time**: The average time taken to resolve a technician’s issue.
- **Escalation Rate**: Percentage of queries that require escalation to a human expert.
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback from technicians on the quality and effectiveness of the AI’s responses.
- **System Reliability**: The system’s uptime and availability for technicians.
- **Multilingual Accuracy**: The AI's ability to respond accurately in all supported languages.
